# SBC-Repository
This one is my idea of making a repository specially for Single Board Computer.
I start collecting information and margin in appropriate form. Hopefully can start working from Sep'2015.

Note - 
1. The repository should have option, so other people / group can able to upload their application / program and let people to use it either free / commercial.
2. The requirement of no. 1 is very vast, so far as I understood. But in very fast, I need to develop a platform where its possible to install / develop own application. However a seperate type of OS also a point, that should be develop.
